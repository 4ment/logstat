`logstat` is a simple program replicating some of [tracer]'s functionalities. It takes a posterior sample as input and outputs the effective sample size (ESS) and statistics such as the mean, meadian, and 95% higher posterior density (HPD).

### Dependencies
 - [numpy]
 - [polars]

 ### Installation
To install logstat from source you can run
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/4ment/logstat
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4ment/logstat
pip install logstat/
```

Check install
```bash
logstat --help
```

## Quick start
`logstat` parses log files generated by program such as `beast`.

```bash
logstat samples.log --burnin 0.2
```

Multiple sample files can be provided and the burnin can be specified for each of them using the same order.

```bash
logstat samples1.log samples2.log --burnin 0.2 --burnin 0.3
```
